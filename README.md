## by Aisha Lawal


## Dataset

> The dataset used was the prosper loan dataset. It consisted of borrower APRs. It had a total entry of 113,937 individual loans. The features included in the data set include:  borrower's Prosper rating, loan term,original loan amount, borrower's stated monthly income,  employment status, debt to income ratio, current loan status etc. There were a toral of 81 features given in the dataset. However, for the analusis of the dataset, only 13 were used which are" 'Term', 'LoanStatus', 'BorrowerAPR', 'ProsperScore', 'ListingCategory (numeric)', 'EmploymentStatus','EmploymentStatusDuration', 'IsBorrowerHomeowner', 'DebtToIncomeRatio', 'StatedMonthlyIncome', 'LoanOriginalAmount','LoanOriginationDate', 'MonthlyLoanPayment'.


## Summary of Findings

> During my exploration I got some findings such as:
1. The distribution of BorrowerAPR is a multimodal distribution
2. The loan origin amount are skewed and dont follow a normal distribution. Furthermore, the most frequesnt loaned amount is 4,000 and the least is 2388
3. More people completed thier loan than those that defaulted.
4. There are some negative correlation between some values like BorrowAPR vs ProsperScore and BorrowerAPR vs LoanOriginalAmount. Also a strong positive correlation between loanoroginalamount and monthlyloanpayment- amongst others.
5. The loan amount increases with the loan term.
6. The fact that loans within a shorter period of time had to be paid quicker so the monthly payment was higher.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I looked on 4 main features which are; The correlation between all variables, the distribution of borrower APR, the relationship between LoanOriginalAmount, MonthlyLoanPayment, and Term. Also, i will be looking at the relatioship between BorrowerAPR vs LoanOriginalAmount
